//There are n trees in a forest. The heights of the trees is stored in array tree[], where tree[i] denotes the height of the ith tree in the forest. If the ith tree is cut at a height H, then the wood collected is tree[i] -H, provided tree[i] > H. If the total woods that needs to be collected is exactly equal to k, find the height H at which every tree should be cut (all trees have to be cut at the same height). If it is not possible then return -1 else return H.

//Example 1:

//Input:
//n = 5, k = 4
//nums[] = { 2, 3, 6, 2, 4}
//Output: 3
//Explanation: Wood collected by cutting trees
//at height 3 = 0 + 0 + (6-3) +0 + (4 - 3) = 4
//hence 3 is to be subtracted from all numbers.
//Since 2 is lesser than 3, nothing gets
//subtracted from it.
//Example 2:

//Input:
//n = 6, k = 8
//nums[] = { 1, 7, 6, 3, 4, 7}
//Output: 4
//Explanation: Wood collected by cutting trees
//at height 4 = 0+(7-4)+(6 - 4) + 0 + 0 + (7 - 4) = 8
//Your Task:
//Your task is to complete the function find_height(). This function takes the array tree[ ], and the integers n and k as input parameters and returns the height at which trees have to be cut. If no positive integer value of height is possible, return -1.


//Expected Time Complexity: O(n log h)
//Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


//Constraints:
//1 <= n <= 104
//1 <= tree[i] <= 103
//1 <= k <= 107
